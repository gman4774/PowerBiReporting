# Power Bi Reporting

For this project I was asked to review the data provided and build a two-tab report in Power Bi.

The link for the Power Bi report is here -

## Data Sources
The datasets I was provided:
* dof-summary-of-neighborhood-sales-for-manhattan-for-class-1-2-and-3-family-homes-2009-1.csv
* Earned_Income_Tax_Credit__New_York_City_EITC__Claims__Full-Year_Resident_Totals__by_Size_of_Earned_Income.csv

## Data Insights
* The first report provides information on neighborhood sales for different types of homes in various neighborhoods in Manhattan. This report can be used to compare the real estate market in different neighborhoods and to analyze trends in housing prices. 
* The second report represents the NYC EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) for the tax years 2004-2014. The report is useful for evaluating the impact of the NYC EITC on different income groups and family sizes. It can also help in formulating policies for future tax years.
